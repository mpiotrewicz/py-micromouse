# py-micromouse
Python-based MicroMouse robot simulation environment

## Main features planned
* Graphical maze editor
* 2D maze solving simulation (mouse position/heading visualization, solver algorithm data visualization)
* Communication with the solver program via network socket
* Serial port handling to alow downloading/uploading maze data directly from/to an actual robot
